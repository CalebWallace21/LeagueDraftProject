This was a hobby project created around the popular online video game League of Legends! 
It is built to be a fun team composition builder where you can theorycraft potential team combinations, originally i wanted to be able to include a way to login and save compositions you are interested in and built but functionality for those features is not finished. All the title buttons currently work and will change you between each window but login functionality will not do anything. 
The CSS isnt completly done but is a mock up for how i pictured it originally
